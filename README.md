# WordMaster

This project is a Python-based assistant tool designed to help users solve Wordle puzzles more efficiently. It analyzes a vocabulary of 5-letter words, suggests optimal guesses based on character frequency, and narrows down possible answers using feedback from your Wordle attempts.

## Features

- **Intelligent Guess Suggestions**: Recommends the top 10 words to guess next based on character frequency analysis in the remaining possible words.
- **Interactive Feedback Loop**: After each guess, input the Wordle feedback (Green/Yellow/Gray) to filter the word list.
- **Word Scoring System**: Scores words by the uniqueness and frequency of their letters to prioritize informative guesses.
- **Comprehensive Vocabulary**: Uses a large dataset of valid 5-letter words.

## Quick Start
