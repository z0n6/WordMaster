# WordMaster

This project is a Python-based assistant tool designed to help users solve Wordle puzzles more efficiently. It analyzes a vocabulary of 5-letter words, suggests optimal guesses based on character frequency, and narrows down possible answers using feedback from your Wordle attempts.

## Features

- **Intelligent Guess Suggestions**: Recommends the top 10 words to guess next based on character frequency analysis in the remaining possible words.
- **Interactive Feedback Loop**: After each guess, input the Wordle feedback (Green/Yellow/Gray) to filter the word list.
- **Word Scoring System**: Scores words by the uniqueness and frequency of their letters to prioritize informative guesses.
- **Comprehensive Vocabulary**: Uses a large dataset of valid 5-letter words.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` library (only required for plotting functionality)

### Installation and Setup

1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. (Optional) Install dependencies for plotting functionality:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Playing with the Bot

1. **Start the Program**: Run `python main.py`.

2. **Understand Feedback Codes**:
   - `G`: Green - Correct letter in correct position
   - `Y`: Yellow - Correct letter in wrong position
   - `X`: Gray - Letter not in the word

3. **Gameplay Loop**:
   - The bot displays the top 10 suggested guesses.
   - Choose a guess by entering its number (1-10).
   - Play that word on Wordle.
   - Enter the feedback as a 5-character string (e.g., `GYXXG`).
   - The bot filters possible words and suggests new guesses.
   - Repeat until you win or run out of attempts.

4. **Winning**: If you enter `GGGGG`, the bot congratulates you.

5. **Quitting**: Type `quit` at any prompt to exit.

### Playing Wordle (Practice Mode)

For practice or to play Wordle without the assistant:

1. Run `python play_wordle.py` (after setting up the environment).
2. Guess 5-letter words and receive feedback.
3. Use `--quiet` flag for minimal output (useful for scripting).

### Analyzing Strategies

To analyze different word guessing strategies:

1. Run `python analyze_strategies.py`.
2. The script simulates all strategies against the full vocabulary and saves results to `data/strategy_results.csv`.
3. Strategies include variations based on frequency scoring (Total, Repeat, Unique) and selection methods (Best guess vs. Random from top N).

### Plotting Results

To visualize strategy performance:

1. Ensure `matplotlib` is installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
2. Run `python plot_strategies.py`.
3. The script generates line charts for success rates and failed games, saved as `data/success_rates_line.png` and `data/failed_games_line.png`.

### Example Session

```
Welcome to WordMaster!
I will suggest guesses. After each guess, enter feedback as 5 characters:
G for green (correct letter, correct position)
Y for yellow (correct letter, wrong position)
X for gray (letter not in word)
Example: GYXXG

Attempt 1: Top suggested guesses:
1. AROSE
2. IRATE
3. RAISE
...
Choose a guess by number (1-10) or 'quit' to stop: 1
Enter feedback (or 'quit' to stop): YXYYX
Remaining possible words: 234
...
```

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Main entry point for the Wordle assistant and interactive loop.
- `play_wordle.py`: Standalone Wordle game simulator for practice.
- `analyze_strategies.py`: Script to simulate and analyze different guessing strategies.
- `plot_strategies.py`: Script to plot strategy analysis results.
- `utils.py`: Core logic for word analysis, scoring, and filtering.
- `plot.py`: Script to generate character frequency plots.
- `plot.sh`: Script to set up environment and run plot.py.
- `data/vocabularies.csv`: List of valid 5-letter words.
- `data/word_scores.csv`: Pre-computed word scores (generated if needed).
- `data/strategy_results.csv`: Results from strategy analysis (generated by analyze_strategies.py).
- `data/char_freq.png`: Character frequency visualization (generated if needed).
- `data/success_rates_line.png`: Line chart of success rates by strategy (generated by plot_strategies.py).
- `data/failed_games_line.png`: Line chart of failed games by strategy (generated by plot_strategies.py).
- `data/guess_distribution.png`: Guess distribution visualization (generated if needed).
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## How It Works

1. **Vocabulary Loading**: Loads words from `data/vocabularies.csv`.
2. **Character Analysis**: Analyzes frequency of unique characters across all words.
3. **Word Scoring**: Scores each word based on the frequency of its unique letters.
4. **Guess Suggestion**: Recommends highest-scoring words from remaining possibilities.
5. **Filtering**: Uses Wordle feedback to eliminate impossible words:
   - Green: Must match letter and position.
   - Yellow: Must contain letter but not in that position.
   - Gray: Must not contain letter (unless it's green elsewhere).

This approach maximizes information gained per guess, helping you solve Wordle in fewer attempts.

## TODO

- Make a GUI for both helper and game playing
