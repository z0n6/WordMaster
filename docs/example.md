# Example Session

Welcome to WordMaster!
I will suggest guesses. After each guess, enter feedback as 5 characters:
G for green (correct letter, correct position)
Y for yellow (correct letter, wrong position)
X for gray (letter not in word)
Example: GYXXG

Attempt 1: Top suggested guesses:
1. AROSE
2. IRATE
3. RAISE
...
Choose a guess by number (1-10) or 'quit' to stop: 1
Enter feedback (or 'quit' to stop): YXYYX
Remaining possible words: 234
